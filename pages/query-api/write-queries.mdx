# Write Queries

<Callout type="info" emoji="💡">
`db` is assumed to be the state variable storing the WeaveDB SDK object.

For reference, see [Initialize WeaveDB](/quick-start#initialize-weavedb)
</Callout>

## add

To add a new document:

```js copy
await db.add({ "age": 20, "name": "Bob" }, "collection_name")
```
<Callout type="info" emoji="💡">
The doc id will be randomly yet deterministically assigned.
</Callout>

## set

```js copy
await db.set({ "age": 20, "name": "Bob" }, "collection_name", "doc_id")
```

<Callout type="info" emoji="💡">
This will reset the whole doc if the doc already exists.
</Callout>

## upsert

Upsert will merge the new data with an existing doc or will set a new doc if it does not already exist:

```js copy
await db.upsert({ "age": 20, "name": "Bob" }, "collection_name", "doc_id")
```

## update

```js copy
await db.update({ "age": 25 }, "collection_name", "doc_id")
```

<Callout type="info" emoji="💡">
This will fail if the doc does not exist.
</Callout>

The following is a list of special operations. WeaveDB has shortcuts for common operations that are only available with the SDK and not with the web console terminal at the moment.

### Delete a field

```js copy
await db.update({ "age": db.del() }, "collection_name", "doc_id")
```

### Increase a field

```js copy
await db.update({ "age": db.inc(5) }, "collection_name", "doc_id")
```

### Decrease a field

```js copy
await db.update({ "age": db.inc(-5) }, "collection_name", "doc_id")
```

### Array union

```js copy
await db.update({ "chars": db.union([ "a", "b", "c", "d" ]) }, "collection_name", "doc_id")
```

### Array remove

```js copy
await db.update({ "chars": db.union([ "b", "c" ]) }, "collection_name", "doc_id")
```

### Set block timestamp
```js copy
await db.update({ "date": db.ts() }, "collection_name", "doc_id")
```

### Set signer Ethereum address
```js copy
await db.update({ "address": db.signer() }, "collection_name", "doc_id")
```

## delete

Delete a doc

```js copy
await db.delete("collection_name", "doc_id")
```

## batch

An atomic batch is a feature that allows you to perform multiple read and write operations as a single, atomic unit. 

Atomic means that all the operations within the batch are either fully completed or completely aborted. If any of the write operations fail, none of the changes will be applied to the database, ensuring data integrity.

```js copy
await db.batch([
  ["set", { name: "Bob" }, "people", "Bob"],
  ["upsert", { name: "Alice" }, "people", "Alice"],
  ["delete", "John"]
])
```

<Callout type="info" emoji="💡">
You can use batch only if all the queries are by the same signer. If you have multiple signers, use [bundle](write-queries#bundle).
</Callout>

Admin queries can be batch-executed as well:

```js copy
await db.batch([
  ["setSchema", schema, "people"],
  ["setRules", rules, "people"],
  ["addOwner", "0xABC"]
], { ar : admin_arweave_wallet })
```

## bundle

Bundle multiple queries from multiple signers

```js copy
const query1 = await db.sign("set", {name: "Bob"}, "people", "Bob", {evm: wallet1})
const query2 = await db.sign("set", {name: "Alice"}, "people", "Alice", {ii: wallet2})
const query3 = await db.sign("set", {name: "Beth"}, "people", "Beth", {ar: wallet3})

await db.bundle([query1, query2, query3], {ar: bundler_wallet})
```

## sign

Sign a query without sending a transaction:

```js copy
await db.sign("set", {name: "Bob", age: 20}, "collection_name", "doc_id")
```

## relay

Relay a query:

```js copy
const param = await db.sign("set", {name: "Bob"}, "collection_name", "doc_id")
const extra = { age: 20 }
await db.relay("jobID", param, extra, {evm: relayer_wallet})
```
